//! Resolved placement tree handed from `AvmRenderer::build_snapshot`
//! to `render::render_snapshot`. Captures every AVM1 runtime override
//! (effective transforms with `_xscale/_yscale/_rotation`, alpha
//! composed with `_alpha`, dynamic `attachMovie` placements, removed
//! sprites = empty subtrees) so the renderer never needs to read
//! engine state — it just walks the tree and emits Vello commands.
//!
//! Why a tree rather than per-tick mutation: tests can hand-craft
//! snapshots without instantiating an AvmEngine, and AVM1 changes
//! never break the renderer (snapshot is the contract).
